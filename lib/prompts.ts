Job Title: {{JOB_TITLE}}

Evaluation Weights (JSON):
{{WEIGHTS}}

Candidate Resume:
{{RESUME_TEXT}}
-------------------------------

Instructions:
- Use the scoring weights to calculate a total score from 0 to 100.
- Base the score on job title matches, keywords, experience, or other indicators provided in the weights.
- If the resume does not contain strong enough matches, give a lower score.
- If it meets most or all criteria, give a higher score.
- Use your best judgment based on the resume contents.

A score greater than or equal to {{QUALIFICATION_THRESHOLD}} is considered "qualified".

  "qualified": true or false
}
